Hosting your own apt/yum repositories is a very user friendly way of distributing linux binaries.
Owing to the nature of how they are packaged, it's as easy to just use any object storage to simply act
as an apt or yum repository. With Cloudflare's amazing R2 object storage service that offers 0 egress fees,
this becomes trivial and near free to set up.

See here for my detailed blog when I did this work as a side project during my time in Cloudflare:
