      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a Go(for work) and Rust(for fun) lately. I got pulled into the two languages for different reasons (easy concurrency and memory safety respectively)
and ended up staying for a totally different reason altogether. Their type systems.
Composition instead of inheritance. It feels elegant, right and very readable. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about something that happened today when I was super thankful for composition and typing itself.</description>
